**Title**: Online Appointment Booking

**As a** Customer
**I want** to book appointments online
**So that** I can easily schedule appointments at my convenience without having to call or email.

**Business Logic**:
- Bookings should not overlap.
- A confirmation email should be sent to the customer *only* after admin approval.
- Cancellations should be allowed up to 24 hours before the appointment time.
- Booking requests must be approved by an admin before they are confirmed.
- The admin appointment list page should include an approval status column. The default status should be "Pending" and change to "Approved" after admin approval.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Users can view available time slots for a given service.
2. Users can select a time slot and submit a booking request.
3. Users receive a confirmation email *only* after their booking is approved by an admin.
4. The system prevents double-booking of time slots.
5. The system handles invalid input gracefully.
6. Users can cancel appointments up to 24 hours in advance.
7. The admin appointment list displays the approval status of each booking request.
